The angent will finally ready the target location by a small chance since the map in finite when set enforce_deadline to false. The rewards are negative."

    "Answers: It begins to reach the destination on time and get positive final reward. But with a high chance the agent will stuck in a rut to just make right turns in a loop all the time and miss the deadline. Maybe it's because I set the learning rate(0.5) and gamma(0.7) too high so that the agent by a chance make a lot of right turn at the begining and quickly learns it can make more right turns to collect a reward of 2. Even in the situation it should make a left turn, it sacrifise to get a negative reward -0.5 (since action != agent.get_next_waypoint())  in order to make three more right turns because the q table shows more action values.\n",

    "The other way is to us a exploration function. I implement it in function _next_action_index_with_exploration_. The basic idea is cache the time of state->action the agent have tried. If it doesn't meet a certain threshold(_self.NE_) then we use a certain positive q_value for that state->action (_self.reward_plus_). After we meet enought numbers of that state->action status, we begin to use the values we've learned in q_table. I set _self.NE_ to be 2\n",
