    "   Strengths:\n",
    "   - Using Kernel trick to fit nonlinear data\n",
    "   - No local optimal, unlike in neural networks\n",
    "   - It scales relatively well to high dimensional data\n",
    "   - Tradeoff between classifier complexity and error can be controlled explicitly\n",
    "   - Non-traditional data like strings((string kernal)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_kernel] )and trees((tree kernal)[http://papers.nips.cc/paper/2089-convolution-kernels-for-natural-language.pdf]) can be used as input to SVM, instead of feature vectors.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   weaknesses:\n",
    "   - Requires full labeling of input data, which means the training data should include at least one positive and one negative categories.\n",
    "   - Uncalibrated class membership probabilities, which means svm gives an answer for classification, but gives poor (probability estimates)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platt_scaling]. On the contrast, for example, Naive Bayes Model can give a prediction of label and a degree of certainty about the answer(the posterior probability)\n",
    "   - If the number of features is much greater than the number of samples, the method is likely to give poor performances.\n",
    "   - The SVM is only directly applicable for two-class tasks. Therefore, algorithms that reduce the multi-class task to several binary problems have to be applied;\n",
    "   - Parameters of a solved model are difficult to interpret. Which means it's hard to tell the relationship between the feature weights we got with corresponded features, expecially when using kernels. On the contrast, decision tree model can tell which feature is more important.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Based on the experiments you performed earlier, in 1-2 paragraphs explain to the board of supervisors what single model you chose as the best model. Which model is generally the most appropriate based on the available data, limited resources, cost, and performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the F1 scores on test set, KNN has the best performace. AdaBoost and SVM have slightly lower performance and AdaBoost talks much longer time to train and predict. So based on the small available data set, I will recommand k-NN\n",
    "\n",
    "- In 1-2 paragraphs explain to the board of supervisors in layman's terms how the final model chosen is supposed to work (for example if you chose a Decision Tree or Support Vector Machine, how does it make a prediction).\n",
    "\n",
    "So k-NN works with the assumption that students with simmilar performace(features) will have same final results(pass/not pass). For example, given an student A, who absents a lot, we find other 20 students in our records who also absent a lot and 19 of them needs intervention, we can conclude that A is also need intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to define the simmilarity of students, we design a feature template to represent each student. Like the student's age, sex, absence time etc. By feeding the values in, we can have a feature vector to describe the attribute of each student we care. There're many ways to measure how two vectors are similar with each other, for example we can use cosine similarity of two feature vectors. Consine similarity can give us a range between -1 and 1, 1 means totaly the same and -1 means totally different. When comes with a new student data, we find the most k similar students in our training data, if most of the k student pass, then we will predict the new student will pass too and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fine-tune the model. Use Gridsearch with at least one important parameter tuned and with at least 3 settings. Use the entire training set for this.\n",
    "\n",
